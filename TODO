Why is <ALT-GR>+<m> giving a UTF8 error??? Coming from the treeview.

I have a five client scenario that crashes almost always immediately:
$> ./Source/died
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost --serve 5690
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost:5690 --serve 0
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost --serve 0
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost --serve 5691
WHY??

Add Server.vClose

Prevent user from typing.

Debug widget can be turned off with NODEBUG. Compiled in is standard but has to be turned on with --debug.

Process event queue on reconnect.
