Why is <ALT-GR>+<m> giving a UTF8 error???

I have a five client scenario that crashes almost always immediately:
$> ./Source/died
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost --serve 5690
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost:5690 --serve 0
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost --serve 0
$> ./Source/died --connect localhost --serve 5691
WHY??
